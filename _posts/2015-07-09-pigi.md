Pigi is a command line tool written in Ruby that automatically adds your Pivotal Tracker story ID into your commit message. The purpose of this tool is to speed up development process of developers using [Github’s service hook for Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/community/tracker-blog/guide-githubs-service-hook-tracker).

<!--more-->

If you've ever worked on a project that used Github and Pivotal Tracker you've probably used [Github’s service hook for Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/community/tracker-blog/guide-githubs-service-hook-tracker). This is a really cool feature that let's you see clearly which commit contributed to which Pivotal Tracker story, but there was one thing that was disturbing my workflow when I was committing my changes. Every time I had to copy Pivotal Tracker story ID from the website and then paste it into my commit message. I searched for available solutions to automate this process, but I couldn't find anything relevant, so I decided to build my own tool called **Pigi**.

### Installation

You can install Pigi as a [RubyGem](https://rubygems.org/gems/pigi):

```shell
$ gem install pigi
```

### Usage

When you begin to work on a particular story in Pivotal Tracker firstly set ID (for example ID = 12345678) of this story by executing a command:

```shell
$ pigi s 12345678
```
	
Now every time you want to commit changes in your git repository you do it by typing:

```shell
$ pigi m "add awesome feature"
```
	
The result of this command is identical to this command:

```shell
$ git commit -m "add awesome feature [#12345678]"
```

If you want to work on another story just simply set pigi to your current story ID that you are working on:

```shell
$ pigi s 87654321
```

### Pigi code

Pigi source code is available on my [Github page](https://github.com/aleksandergrzyb/PivotalGithubHelper).
